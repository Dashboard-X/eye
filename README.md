# eye
A HTML & CSS eye that uses head-tracking and your webcam to follow you around. Intentionally unnerving.

### Kudos
- The idea for this project came from Professor Golan Levin's [Opto Isolator](http://flong.com/projects/optoisolator/) project.
- This implementation relies on Martin Tschirsich's [ObjectDetect](https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect) library and classifiers for head tracking.
